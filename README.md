# Option Pricing and Market Risk Analytics

A comprehensive implementation of option pricing models and market risk analytics in Python. This project covers the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of derivatives pricing, from the Black-Scholes model to Value-at-Risk calculations.

## Overview

This project is structured in phases, each building on the previous:

| Phase | Topic | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Black-Scholes Model & Greeks | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Implied Volatility & Market Data | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Monte Carlo Pricing | 🔄 In Progress |
| 4 | Value-at-Risk (VaR) & Expected Shortfall | ⏳ Planned |

## Phase 1: Black-Scholes Model & Greeks

### Mathematical Foundation

The Black-Scholes model prices European options by solving a partial differential equation derived from no-arbitrage principles. The key insight is that an option can be perfectly hedged by continuously adjusting a position in the underlying stock, eliminating the need to estimate expected returns.

**The Black-Scholes PDE:**

```
∂V/∂t + rS(∂V/∂S) + ½σ²S²(∂²V/∂S²) = rV
```

**Solution for a European Call:**

```
C = S·N(d₁) - Ke^(-r(T-t))·N(d₂)
```

where:

```
d₁ = [ln(S/K) + (r + ½σ²)(T-t)] / [σ√(T-t)]
d₂ = d₁ - σ√(T-t)
```

### The Greeks

The Greeks measure option price sensitivity to various parameters:

| Greek | Symbol | Measures Sensitivity To | Formula (Call) |
|-------|--------|------------------------|----------------|
| Delta | Δ | Stock price | N(d₁) |
| Gamma | Γ | Stock price (2nd order) | n(d₁) / [Sσ√T] |
| Theta | Θ | Time decay | -[S·n(d₁)·σ] / [2√T] - rKe^(-rT)N(d₂) |
| Vega | ν | Volatility | S√T·n(d₁) |
| Rho | ρ | Interest rate | KTe^(-rT)N(d₂) |

### Implementation

- `black_scholes.py` — Core pricing functions for European calls and puts
- `greeks.py` — Analytical Greek calculations
- `visualizations.py` — Price and sensitivity visualizations

### Sample Output

```
Black-Scholes Option Pricing
========================================
Stock Price (S):     $100.00
Strike Price (K):    $100.00
Time to Expiry (T):  1 year(s)
Risk-free Rate (r):  5.0%
Volatility (σ):      20.0%
----------------------------------------
Call Price:          $10.4506
Put Price:           $5.5735
```

## Phase 2: Implied Volatility & Market Data

### What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility (IV) is the volatility that makes the Black-Scholes price match the observed market price. It represents the market's expectation of future volatility.

**The Problem:** Given market price, solve for σ in:

```
C_market = BS(S, K, T, r, σ)
```

There's no closed-form solution — we use numerical methods.

### Newton-Raphson Method

We use Newton-Raphson iteration with vega as the derivative:

```
σ_{n+1} = σ_n - (BS(σ_n) - C_market) / vega(σ_n)
```

Converges in 2-4 iterations typically.

### The Volatility Smile

Black-Scholes assumes constant volatility across all strikes. Reality disagrees.

**What the smile tells us:**
- **OTM puts are expensive** — Investors pay premium for crash protection
- **Negative skew** — Left side (puts) higher than right side (calls)
- **Fat tails** — Market expects more extreme moves than log-normal distribution

### Implementation

- `implied_volatility.py` — Newton-Raphson IV solver with convergence handling
- `market_data.py` — Real market data fetching and analysis using Yahoo Finance

### Real Market Data Analysis

The project fetches live option data and Treasury rates:

```
VOLATILITY SMILE ANALYSIS: SPY
============================================================
Risk-free rate (3m): 3.58% (from Treasury yield)

Market Data:
  Spot Price: $689.23
  Expiry: 2026-01-27
  Days to Expiry: 1

Quadratic fit: IV = 15.6% + -111.7%·x + 1848.0%·x²
  ATM vol: 15.63%
  Skew: -1.1170 (negative = crash protection premium)
  Smile: 18.4796 (curvature)
```

### Visualizations

#### Real Market Volatility Smile (SPY)
![Market Smile](phase2_implied_volatility/images/09_market_smile.png)

The classic equity skew: OTM puts (left) trade at much higher IV than OTM calls (right). This is the price of crash protection.

#### Market Data vs Quadratic Model Fit
![Model Fit](phase2_implied_volatility/images/10_market_vs_model.png)

A simple quadratic model captures the general shape of the smile, though market microstructure creates scatter.

#### Smile Term Structure
![Term Structure](phase2_implied_volatility/images/11_smile_term_structure.png)

How the smile shape changes across expiration dates. Shorter expiries show more pronounced effects.

## Phase 3: Monte Carlo Pricing

### Why Monte Carlo?

Monte Carlo simulation can price any option, including path-dependent options that have no closed-form solution.

| Option Type | Black-Scholes | Monte Carlo |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| European call/put | ✓ Exact formula | ✓ Works |
| Asian options (average price) | ✗ No formula | ✓ Works |
| Barrier options (knock-in/out) | Partial | ✓ Works |
| Lookback options | ✗ No formula | ✓ Works |

### The Method

1. Simulate stock price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion
2. Calculate the option payoff for each path
3. Average the payoffs
4. Discount to present value

```
Option Price = e^(-rT) × (1/N) × Σ Payoff_i
```

### Risk-Neutral Valuation

We simulate under the risk-neutral measure where the stock grows at rate r, not μ:

```
S(T) = S(0) × exp[(r - ½σ²)T + σ√T × Z]
```

The (r - ½σ²) term is the Itō correction that ensures correct expected value.

### Implementation

- `monte_carlo.py` — Full Monte Carlo pricing engine with:
  - European options (validated against Black-Scholes)
  - Asian options (arithmetic and geometric average)
  - Barrier options (down-and-out, down-and-in, up-and-out, up-and-in)
  - Lookback options (floating and fixed strike)
  - Antithetic variates for variance reduction
  - Convergence analysis

### Sample Output

```
Monte Carlo Option Pricing
============================================================
Parameters: S0=$100, K=$100, T=1y, r=5.0%, sigma=20.0%

1. EUROPEAN CALL OPTION
Black-Scholes Call Price: $10.4506
Monte Carlo Call Price:   $10.4115 +/- $0.0909 (95% CI)
Error vs BS:              $0.0391

3. ASIAN CALL OPTION (Arithmetic Average)
Monte Carlo Asian Call:   $5.7717 +/- $0.0496
Compared to European:     $-4.6398 (Asian is cheaper)

4. BARRIER CALL OPTION (Down-and-Out, Barrier=$80)
Monte Carlo Barrier Call: $10.3780 +/- $0.0912
Compared to European:     $-0.0335 (Barrier is cheaper)

5. LOOKBACK CALL OPTION (Floating Strike)
Monte Carlo Lookback Call: $16.6759 +/- $0.0911
Compared to European:      $+6.2644 (Lookback is more expensive)
```

### Convergence Analysis

Monte Carlo converges at rate O(1/√N):

```
Paths increased by:    10x (1,000 -> 10,000)
Std Error reduced by:  3.12x
Theoretical reduction: 3.16x (1/sqrt(N) rule)
```

To halve the error, you need 4x more paths.
